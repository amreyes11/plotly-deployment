OVERVIEW

The purpose of this project is to grow on the work that Roza has already established.  The interactive dashboard created will allow the user to explore belly botton microbes that colonize the human navals based on OTUs, operational taxonomic units.  The dashboard will be able to show data based off of each test subject and their specific type of present colonization.
